# Breast Cancer Detection

To train the model, I used a dataset from the "UCI" archive provided by "Dr. Wolberg" in 1992. There are 10 dependent and 1 independent variables in the dataset. We will determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant according to 10 dependent variables. 2 means benign, 4 means malignant.

Attribute Information:

1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
